# To change to another path, use `cd <path>`, for example:
# cd /projects/<allocationID>

# mycode.do is your Stata script.  If it's not in the working directory set above, add 
# the full or relative path as appropriate
stata-mp -b do mycode $ARG1 $ARG2 $ARG3
# Stata output will be in mycode.log in the working directory.

# There will also be a job output file called <jobname>.o<jobID> 
# in the directory from which you submit the job with information from the scheduler

# From the command line, in the directory with this file, submit this job with:
# sbatch --export=ARG1=3,ARG2=hello,ARG3=4.5 myjob.sh
