# Example Quest Jobs

This repository contains example job submission and application scripts for use on Quest.  We are still adding additional examples and languages/applications to it, so if there are examples you'd find useful, please [let us know](mailto:quest-help@northwestern.edu).

In all cases, you need to update the information in the scripts as appropriate to your allocation, the computing resources you need, and your files/directories.  

See [Quest Documentation](https://kb.northwestern.edu/page.php?id=72406) for more information.  This repository is a supplement to that documentation.

## Conventions

In the examples, items in `<>` are things you need to fill in with appropriate values.  Don't include the `<>` when you substitute a value.

In the example job submission files (`.sh` file extensions), there are commented lines at the end of the script giving an example of how to submit this job on Quest.  These `msub` commands should be run from the command line.  They are not part of the job submission script (so they should remain commented out).

## Download this repository

To copy this repository onto Quest, use the following command while in the directory you want to put these files:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuitrcs/examplejobs.git
```

That will create a directory called `examplejobs` with all of the content from this repository.
